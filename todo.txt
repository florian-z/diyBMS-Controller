Quarz an XTAL/EXTAL

18.5 Handling of Unused Pins (MAN p.357)
The configuration of unused pins is listed in Table 18.8.
Note 1. Clear the PORTn.PMR bit, the PmnPFS.ISEL bit and the PmnPFS.ASEL bit to 0.
Note 2. In the case of release when the setting is for output, the port is an input over the period from release from the reset state to the
pin becoming an output. Since the voltage on the pin is undefined while it is an input, this may lead to an increase in the current
drawn.
Table 18.8 Unused Pin Configuration
Pin Name Description
MD (Always used as mode pins)
RES# Connect this pin to VCC via a pull-up resistor.
P35/NMI Connect this pin to VCC via a pull-up resistor.
P36/EXTAL When the main clock is not used, set the MOSCCR.MOSTP bit to 1 (general port P36).
When this pin is not used as port P36 either, it is configured in the same way as port 1 to port 3, port 5, port A
to port E, port H, port J.
P37/XTAL When the main clock is not used, set the MOSCCR.MOSTP bit to 1 (general port P37).
When this pin is not used as port P37 either, it is configured in the same way as port 1 to port 3, port 5, port A
to port E, port H, port J.
When the external clock is input to the EXTAL pin, leave this pin open.
XCIN Connect this pin to VSS via a pull-down resistor.
XCOUT Leave this pin open.
Ports 1 to 3, 5
Ports A to E, H, J
(except for J6, J7)
• If the direction setting is for input (PORTn.PDR = 0), the corresponding pin is connected to VCC (pulled up)
via a resistor or to VSS (pulled down) via a resistor.*1
• If the direction setting is for output (PORTn.PDR = 1), the pin is released.*1, *2
Ports 0, 4, J (J6, J7) • If the direction setting is for input (PORTn.PDR = 0), the corresponding pin is connected to AVCC0 (pulled
up) via a resistor or to AVSS0 (pulled down) via a resistor.*1
• If the direction setting is for output (PORTn.PDR = 1), the pin is released.*1, *2
PJ6/VREFH0 When this pin is not used as VREFH0, set the PJ6PFS.ASEL bit to 0 (general port PJ6).
When this pin is not also used as port PJ6, handle it in the same way as the handling of Ports 1 to 3, 5, A to
E, H, J (except for J6, J7).
PJ7/VREFL0 When this pin is not used as VREFL0, set the PJ7PFS.ASEL bit to 0 (general port PJ7).
When this pin is not also used as port PJ7, handle it in the same way as the handling of Ports 1 to 3, 5, A to
